Dear ${toName},

${longFromName} has added you as a contributor to a collaborative 
web site at YakJive.com.  YakJive offers a do-it-yourself online 
newspaper creation service and ${shortFromName} has decided to invite
you participate in ${fromSexPossesive} custom site.

To view ${shortFromName}'s site go to the following URL:

   ${rootURL}

To log into your account please use the following URL and login info:

   ${adminURL}login.py
   Username: ${username}
   Password: ${password}
   
${shortFromName} also gave you a penname to reference you on your articles.  
You may change your penname when you log in for the first time.  Your
penname is:  ${penname}
   
After logging in and accepting the Terms and Conditions of Service for
YakJive, contact ${shortFromName} and find out exactly what kind of
articles that ${fromSex} hopes you will write.  We've already started a 
personal blog for you called "${penname}'s Blog."  You may customize
the name of your blog and add articles to the site after you have
logged into your site.

From there, your imagination is your only limit.

Some of the features that you will find on YakJive are:

   * Wizards that guide you through the site's user-friendly tools
   * Add your own articles to a variety of subject-specific Newspages
   * Create new Newspages with your own subjects
   * Create whole Sections of the site to organize related Newspages
   * Add a photo to each article
   * Add address information to articles
   * Customize the site's styles and design
   * Manage the layout of headlines and Newspages within Sections
   * Create a personal bio
   * Hide articles that are in-progress from being 'published'
   
   * ... and much more!
   
(Some of the features that are available to you may depend upon the
permissions granted to you by ${shortFromName}.)

Just because you're a member of ${shortFromName}'s YakJive
group, doesn't mean that you can't have your own YakJive site
as well.  If you'd like to start your own online 
newspaper about knitting, puppies,
your family, peach trees, brewing root beer, or anything else, just go to 
http://www.YakJive.com and enter the signup code: ${code}

If you don't know ${longFromName} or believe that you have received
this email in error, please contact ${fromEmail} directly.  You may
also send an email to ${problemEmail}.

We hope that you enjoy your experience at YakJive and that you 
have lots to contribute.

Thanks for checking out YakJive.
